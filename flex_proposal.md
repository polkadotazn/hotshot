# Hot Shot
#### A phone app for sharing events and moments in your area
## Background and Overview
With this app, users can capture moments via snippets of video and share them locally. Other people can then upvote or downvote videos, as well as search for videos by category. Users can gain karma by sharing videos that are popular among other users.
## Functionality and MVP

- [ ] Videos have a category label
- [ ] Users can search videos by category
- [ ] Top users
## Technologies & Technical Challenges
##### Backend: Firebase
##### Frontend: Swift (application logic), Xcode (UI implementation)
##### Frameworks: AVFoundation (for camera access, allows Swift to communicate with camera hardware)
Challenges
* accessing camera using AVFoundation and building a GUI to allow users to take videos within the app
* integration of Google maps and utilizing geolocation
* periodic deletion of videos
* integrating backend language with Firebase
